Consult chapters 2 and 3 of the Computing Systems book.

This is a game path idea for people interested in either learning more about bit-level
representations and manipulations, or wanting to practice / show their skills in them by
jumping up to the more advanced areas sooner.

The intention will be to explore in some meaningful detail ALL of the primary bit manipulation
tools: AND, OR, NOT, XOR. We'lll be using digital circuits to understand how these are implemented
on a CPU more in depth; anyone interested in diving deeper into this part of CPUs will be
interested in this path.

This path will culminate in creating at least one CPU VM, in this case oriented around lots of
low-level binary details. The "bit munging" flavor CPU :)
